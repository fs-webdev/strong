Strong i18n
===========

Simply the best way to internationalize your Node.js app if you're
serious about your work.

Install It
----------

We haven't released it to the public yet; it's dev-only.

    git clone git@github.com:timshadel/strong.git
    cd strong
    npm link

Connect it to your app:

    npm link strong

Use It
------

`views/home/index.eco`:

    <!-- Use a local view key -->
    <h1><%=t '.title' %></h1>
    <!-- Use a global key -->
    <h1><%=t '*common_title' %></h1>

`app.coffee`:

    configure ->
      app.register '.eco' strong.attractors( zappa.adapter 'eco' )

`locales/home/index/en.json`:

    {
      "title": "My Page Title"
    }

`locales/en.json`:

    {
      "common_title": "Everyone Should Use This Title!!"
    }


Stuff You Care About
--------------------

* Each view has its own translations file.
* Translation keys are organized into a hierarchy to match your views.
* You can use "global" keys in any view.
* It's separated into an API and a simple default backend, which you can
  replace.
* It won't cloud your JavaScript global namespace.
* It "just works" with Node.js, Connect, Express, and Zappa when you use
  Jade, EJS, Eco, or other standard view templating libraries.
* Works in CoffeeScript and JavaScript.


How To Run the Unit Tests
-------------------------

First, make sure to install the module's dependencies:

    npm install -d

Now run jasmine:

    ./node_modules/.bin/jasmine-node spec

You should see the tests run.


Write Your Own Backend
----------------------

Want to store your translations in Redis, MongoDB, or some other cool
new thing? It's easy. The API will handle all the substitutions, and
selection among pluralization options.

*API-Backend Contract*

This is how the API will expect to access the translations.

*Replace the storage backend*

    strong.back = require('strong-redis');

*It must respond to `navigate` calls like this:*

    # All keys will be of the form '[locale].[path].[key]'
    strong.back.navigate('en.home.index.title');

*When that key corresponds to a message that should be pluralized, return a Map:*

    {
        'one': '1 message'
      , 'other': '%{count} messages'
    }

*Otherwise, simply return the string:*

    'Hello, %{name.first}'

And you're done!
